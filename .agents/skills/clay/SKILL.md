## Setup (Run Once Per Session)

Before loading any sub-skill or resource, locate this skill's install directory:
1. Use Glob to search for `**/clay/SKILL.md` (exclude matches inside `.claude/skills/`)
2. The directory containing this SKILL.md is `SKILL_BASE`
3. Sub-skills are at: `{SKILL_BASE}/.claude/skills/{sub-skill}/SKILL.md`
4. Resources are at: `{SKILL_BASE}/resources/...`

Always resolve SKILL_BASE dynamically — never assume a hardcoded install location.

## Universal Principles

These apply to ALL Clay workflows regardless of sub-skill:

1. **Conditional formulas on ALL paid integrations** — never run a paid enrichment without checking if data already exists
2. **Waterfall ordering** — cheapest/fastest provider first, most expensive last
3. **GPT-4 Mini for 90% of AI tasks** — only use GPT-4/Claude for complex reasoning
4. **Save all paid data** — push to CRM or Supabase ($30/month for 11.4M+ records), never pay twice
5. **Test with 50 rows first** — before running on full table
6. **Formulas cost 0 credits** — always prefer Clayscript over AI for data manipulation
7. **Single provider = ~40% coverage, waterfall = 85%+** — always use waterfalls for email/phone

## Response Format

1. Recommend the specific Clay features/columns needed
2. Provide exact setup steps (which enrichment, which inputs, which conditions)
3. Estimate credit cost and suggest optimizations
4. Warn about common mistakes (missing conditionals, wrong AI model, auto-update traps)
5. Include Clayscript formulas when relevant
